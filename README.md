## Development

This repo comes with a helper script to run both the Vue development server and Express application in the same terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Either application can also be run individually:

```sh
# Start the Express application with reloading via nodemon
npm run dev:server

# Start the Vue application with HMR and Reloading
npm run dev:client
```
